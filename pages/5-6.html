    <h1>5-6. Off the Shelf</h1>

    <div>
    <p>
      A few weeks later, when he’s in the office and in for his meeting, you ask TMitTB if there’s a way to use more off-the-shelf components, a way to buy your way out of this.
      <br/><br/>
      He makes a face. Sort of, he says, but when you’re making a system that will integrate with the systems around it and your company is a set of such systems, nothing is truly off the shelf. There are tools and packages and libraries, and if you have any wit at all you already use well-documented, free code for things such as e-mail validation, but that obviates only so much.
      <br/><br/>
      “Everything is edge cases,” he says. “Testing and edge cases.”
      <bbr/><br/>
      You come to the conclusion: The world is broken.
